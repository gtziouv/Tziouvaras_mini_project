# Mini-Project: Data Analysis and Regression

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from `Rural_66.xlsx`, performs data visualizations, and runs an OLS regression model to investigate relationships between variables.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Analysis
Ensure `Rural_66.xlsx` is in the project directory, then execute:
```sh
python miniproject.py
```

## Project Components
- `miniproject.py`: The main script containing functions for data loading, visualization, and regression analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file with setup instructions.

## Expected Outputs
- Histograms for key variables.
- Regression results with variable significance and model relevance.

## Future Improvements
- Additional statistical tests.
- More advanced visualizations.
- Consideration of potential biases in the model.
